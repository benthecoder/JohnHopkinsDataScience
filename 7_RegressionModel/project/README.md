# Regression Models Final Assignment 

You work for Motor Trend, a magazine about the automobile industry. Looking at a data set of a collection of cars, they are interested in exploring the relationship between a set of variables and miles per gallon (MPG) (outcome). They are particularly interested in the following two questions:

* “Is an automatic or manual transmission better for MPG”
* "Quantify the MPG difference between automatic and manual transmissions"  

## Review criteria

Peer Grading

The criteria that your classmates will use to evaluate and grade your work are shown below.
Each criteria is binary: (1 point = criteria met acceptably; 0 points = criteria not met acceptably)
